    full qualified name in the Olson database, so something like Australia/Adelaide
    or America/Los_Angeles. These are standardized descriptors of the timezones used
    in the world, and you can use these in pretty much every programming language
    ever used in the last few decades.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\r\n\r\nhttps://zachholman.com/talk/utc-is-enough-for-everyone-right"
